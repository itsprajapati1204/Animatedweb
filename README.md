<h1>🚀 Just Launched a New Website Using HTML, CSS, JS & Lenis!</h1>

I’m excited to share my latest project: a brand-new website built from the ground up using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Lenis for smooth, modern scrolling effects! 🎉

Here’s a quick breakdown of the tech I used:

💻 HTML: Structured the foundation of the site, ensuring clear navigation, SEO-friendly content, and accessibility.

🎨 CSS: Crafted a responsive, visually appealing design. Leveraged Flexbox and Grid for layout, ensuring the site looks great on all devices.

⚙️ JavaScript: Added dynamic interactivity and handled user interactions to make the site feel fluid and engaging.

🌟 Lenis: Integrated Lenis for a sleek, buttery-smooth scrolling experience that elevates the UX to a whole new level.

This combination of technologies allowed me to create a fast, interactive, and user-centric site. If you're looking for an elegant and seamless web experience, definitely check out Lenis—it’s a game-changer!
